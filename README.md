### Problem Statement:
- Create a flask and python website.
- The website should have four things: an upload and submit field to upload an Excel file, a download button, a sample template, and instructions.
- Once uploaded, use your unique API key for OpenWeatherMap to look up the weather for both cities.
- Using OpenPyXL, write weather information to both sheets.
- Create an Excel chart on both sheets
- On the third worksheet: Create a comparison of the weather for both cities with words/numbers and a chart.
- Flash a message to the website using jinja that the file is ready to download.
- When the user presses the download button, it should download the new Excel sheet with the weather report and charts.
